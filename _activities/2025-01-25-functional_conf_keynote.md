This keynote shares 12 years of experience integrating the Erlang/Elixir ecosystem (BEAM) into a university-level Software Architecture course. We'll explore how the unique combination of Functional Programming (FP) principles, coupled with Erlang/Elixir's robust concurrency and distribution model, fosters a hands-on, experiential understanding of key architectural concepts. We'll explain how using the BEAM has been key in empowering students to grasp and implement architectural styles like microservices, leader-worker or peer-to-peer architectures with greater ease and confidence. The presentation will also emphasize the importance of industry-academia collaboration in nurturing a thriving ecosystem for FP technologies and inspiring future generations of software professionals.
