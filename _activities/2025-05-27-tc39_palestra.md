Gleam is a new language for Erlang's BEAM virtual machine that brings in a robust type system, something long awaited by part of the BEAM community. Gleam maintains the expressiveness of functional programming and profits from the highly concurrent fault-tolerant Erlang runtime. The design of the language is very concise, so it features no null values, no exceptions, simple error messages. And on top of it all, JavaScript is supported as a compile target, so Gleam code can be run in a browser or any other JS-enabled runtime. During this session, we will quickly (1) go over the history of the BEAM and the recent explosion of new languages for this platform, helping the growth of the community in different directions; (2) learn the basics about Gleam.
