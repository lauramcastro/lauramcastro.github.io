The abstraction layer provided by APIs allows heterogeneous systems to communicate easily regardless of their underlying technology. Given its essentiality, organisations devote large amounts of effort to implementing, validating, and maintaining their APIs. API-driven methodologies emerge to improve API development processes. Among them, the design-first methodology prioritises agreeing on a detailed API specification before the implementation step begins. This, unlike a code-first methodology, allows the automation of several tasks that depend on the interface type specification. In this work, a design-first framework for the development of REST APIs in the Erlang programming language is presented. The implemented tools allow exposing runtime reconfigurable HTTP servers with automated request validation and routing based on OpenAPI 3.0 specifications. Furthermore, the framework includes a tool for the automatic testing of the implementation with respect to the specification using property-based testing techniques. As a method of evaluating the produced software, the work includes a comparative analysis against similar tools.
