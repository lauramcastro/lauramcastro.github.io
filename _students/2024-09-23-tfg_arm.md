The idea behind this Bachelor’s Thesis originated from observing the problems that many small businesses face when managing their cash flows. Often, the available tools are too complicated or do not fit these companies’ specific needs. To address this issue, we developed an intuitive web application that leverages the capabilities of Open Banking to offer a simple yet effective solution. The main goal was to allow companies to track and analyze their financial transactions and facilitate decision-making by providing a clear view and complete control over their financial situation. To this end, we included functionalities such as multiple bank account management, bank transaction reconciliation, employee and counterparty management, realtime data visualization, and the possibility to customize the user interface according to their specific needs. The resulting application represents the collaborative effort between two Bachelor Theses, frontend and backend, made possible due to the application of agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, which allowed us to collaborate effectively within the team and adapt to any changes in the requirements. This project focuses on creating the application’s frontend, developed using React and TypeScript, to create a robust and scalable Single Page Application (SPA) that provides a high-quality user experience.
