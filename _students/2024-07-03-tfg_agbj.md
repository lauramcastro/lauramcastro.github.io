The Phoenix framework, much like the broader Elixir ecosystem, strongly emphasises developer experience and ergonomics, with most of its features being well documented and easy to use. One of the notable exceptions is its code generation commands, which present serious usability concerns, discouraging the community from fully investing in such technology. This project aims to correct these issues by providing an environment to facilitate their use and documentation.
