Software testing plays an important role in software development, as it not only helps find bugs in the code, but also boosts the confidence of the developers that the program behaves correctly, besides reducing the cost of fixing such errors or flaws if done in early stages.

One of the most common methods of software testing is unit testing, which tests individual components of the software by asserting whether for cherry-picked test cases (i.e., for a given input), the component or unit produces the expected output. This approach to testing has however its downsides, as it is a tedious time-consuming activity, prone to errors of the developer, such as not covering every possible case.

Property-Based Testing is a method of testing that fixes the problems found in unit testing, for it uses properties, which are simply logical statements that capture partial correctness of the program, to generate random input to test whether the program satisfies those properties or not. However, while automation allows for the execution of many more tests, increasing their number also means longer test running times.

The main goal of this project is to extend PropEr, the most powerful property-based testing tool written in Erlang, with parallel and distributed execution and measure the obtained speedup from doing so.
