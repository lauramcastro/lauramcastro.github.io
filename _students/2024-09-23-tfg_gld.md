In the era of generative technologies, the commercialisation of these technologies threatens the ability of users to access these powerful tools free of charge. Moreover, the existence of multiple options, with different configurations, and the difficulty of using them without technical programming knowledge present severe problems for the non-specialised user.

The main objective of this work is the study and creation of a tool that allows interaction with different LLMs (Large Language Models) through a web application free of charge. In addition, other artificial intelligence technologies such as image generation or object recognition are implemented in this tool. In order to offer a multiprocess architecture that fits to the needs of the system, the Elixir programming language has been used, together with the Phoenix framework, as well as several free APIs for the exploitation of online models, and our own HTTP server to expose locally-running LLMs.
