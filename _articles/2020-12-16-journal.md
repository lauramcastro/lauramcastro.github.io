Programming languages development has intensified in recent years. New ones are created; new features, often cross-paradigm, are featured in old ones.

This new programming landscape makes language selection a more complex decision, both from the companies points of view (technical, recruiting) and from the developers point of view (career development).

In this paper, however, we argue that programming languages have a secondary role in software development design decisions. We illustrate, based on a practical example, how the main influencer are higher-level traits: those traditionally assigned with programming paradigms.

Following this renovated perspective, concerns about language choice are shifted for all parties. Beyond particular syntax, grammar, execution model or code organization, the main consequence of the predominance of one paradigm or another in the mind of the developer is the way solutions are designed.
