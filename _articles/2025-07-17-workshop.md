This research aimed to identify teaching techniques that better align with SPMs' learning styles. Kolb's learning styles test was administered to 27 project managers to determine their preferences in this regard. The surveyed SPMs leaned towards abstract conceptualization, exhibiting a balance between active experimentation and reflective observation, with the thinking style best reflecting these preferences. Building on this, some SPM-centered teaching guides were adapted from existing knowledge on teaching professionals with Kolb's thinking learning style.
