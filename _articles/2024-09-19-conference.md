Right after the Covid-19 pandemics, faculty in charge of a Software Architecture course (3rd year subject of a Software Engineering program) faced an unprecedented increase in enrollment figures, doubling previous numbers to reach over a hundred.
To adapt their teaching methodologies to this situation, they deployed a strategy of early involvement using a gamified programming learning platform during the first weeks of the semester, together with personal learning contracts during the whole duration of the course.
The course had a record success rate of 92%, versus an average of 71% in previous years, but some aspects demand redesign for future versions. First, most students got a full score on their personal learning contracts, and got it early rather than waiting for the semester final weeks; hence, chronological ordering of assignments matters even more than before, as latter assignments may go unfulfilled. Second, many students did this while skipping assignments for some topics, specially visual modeling; hence, learning contracts should stipulate minimal achievements for all learning of special interest.
This work aims, through the detailed analysis of this teaching experience, to serve as an inspiration for other faculty who may face similar realities.
