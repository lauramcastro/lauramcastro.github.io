Regardless of what I mentioned in the previous entry regarding [migration]({% post_url en/2025-07-21-migracion_finalizada %}), this website now features the information regarding my activities over the past five years.

Obviously, I had to cut off at some point, for it was neither feasible nor interesting to include everything that could be part of an academic CV from the beginning of my professional career. In stark contrast to other types of CVs, ours in academia reach great lengths due to the accumulation of activities carried out over the years. However, even in academia, we frequently use "abbreviated" CVs, which only include information precisely from the most recent five years.

Reaching 2020 also seemed like a nice "round" limit, and so it was!

From now on, you can expect updates just whenever I publish new activities in any of the different sections, as one should!
