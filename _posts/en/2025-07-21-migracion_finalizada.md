After the last updates, I think I can consider the migration of this site complete. Following the [initial technological decision]({% post_url en/2025-07-11-nova_version %}), the [customization]({% post_url en/2025-07-14-personalizando %}), and the support for [different languages]({% post_url en/2025-07-16-i18n %}), the only thing left was to fill in the various sections: [publications](/en/publicacions), [teaching](/en/docencia), [dissemination](/en/divulgacion), and [projects](/en/proxectos) (in order of appearance).

Not everything in previous version has been replicated, and there is also new content that was not in place before (namely, information about projects, either [research](/en/proxectos) or those of the [students](/en/docencia#student-projects) I supervise).

From what was left behind, I miss having a podcasts archive, because such information is not easily accessible anywhere else. But I think the way to go will be to have, at some point: an archive for activities (among them, podcasts), an archive for projects, another one for publications, and another for teaching. In the end, all these pages will grow long with time, and actually they can do so rather quickly should I incorporate historical content.
